Hey, I'm a software developer and an open-source contributor.

All my life's role play is split into only two simple things:
* Been 5 years in the industry. Currently, Senior NLP Developer - which buys me daily coffee and pays bills
* Creator and developer at [Aquila Network](https://aquila.network) - which is my contribution to the future (10 - 20 yrs) of technology

I love to learn, design, and collaborate with the greatest minds to build complex systems that stay at the boundaries of technology.

I believe that technology and innovation have always been driven by the community, and dynamic markets **outside the closed walls**. 

Large & slow systems will get replaced by more efficient ones (inc. governments). So, anybody should be able to choose their jurisdictions of participation to survive this. I believe the Internet will enable this.
