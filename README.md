Hey, I'm a software developer and an open source contributor. 

All my life's role play is split into only two simple things:
* Senior NLP Developer at [Accubits](https://accubits.com/) - which buy me daily coffee and pay bills
* Creator and developer at [AquilaDB](https://aquiladb.xyz) - which is my contribution to the future (10 - 20 yrs) of technology

I love to learn, design, and collaborate with greatest minds to build complex systems that stays at the boundaries of technology.

I believe that technology and innovarion has always been driven by the community, and dynamic markets **outside the closed walls**.
